# KMeans Implementation

This project contains a custom implementation of the KMeans clustering algorithm.

## Description

The project includes a Jupyter Notebook that uses NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to generate a dataset, implement the KMeans algorithm, and visualize the results. 
The notebook also compares the results with the KMeans implementation from scikit-learn.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed along with the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Usage

To run the notebook, navigate to the directory containing the notebook and run:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then, open the notebook in the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser.
